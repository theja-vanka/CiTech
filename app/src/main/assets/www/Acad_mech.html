<p align=justify>The Department of Mechanical Engineering was established in 2010-2011 and at present the department has an annual intake of 120 students. Presently the department is affiliated to Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU). The faculty to student ratio is 1:14. Mechanical Engineering emphasizes on Design, Materials &amp; Manufacturing, Thermal Engineering, and also interdisciplinary areas like CAD/CAM/CAE, Automation, Operational Research, Mechatronics, FEM, Managerial Aspects of Industry, etc.</br></p>
<p align=justify>The department is supported by well experienced and qualified faculties. The department emphasizes on high quality teaching and training in the laboratory. Around 98 percent results being continuously achieved in both the theory and practical examinations of VTU. The department houses state of the art laboratory equipped with sophisticated equipment as stipulated by university</br></p>
<p align=justify>The faculty and students have published many research publications in leading National and International journals and conferences. Some of our faculty are Fellow of various National Academies in science and engineering and have received recognition in the form of National and International awards. Much of the research is conducted within the department and some projects are carried out in collaboration with other departments and other R&amp;D institutions.</br></p>
