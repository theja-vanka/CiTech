<p align=justify>The Department of Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering was established at the Cambridge Institute of Technology in 2007 right at the time of inception of the college. Our graduates are employable in almost every technology-based industry: automotive, electric power, space and aerospace, steel and materials, bioengineering, robotics and manufacturing.</p>
<p align=justify>The field of Electrical and Electronic Engineering encompasses many exciting technologies such as power systems, microelectronics, computer systems, which have been among the fastest growing and most challenging technologies that enable the development of the modern information-based society. A characteristic of our Department is that we cover electrical, electronics, computer and information engineering all under one roof, which provides tremendous opportunities for cross interaction both in terms of teaching and research.</p>
<p align=justify>The Department runs an undergraduate programme, namely Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE). The Department currently has full fledged, well experienced teaching staff and about 180 undergraduate students., We have all the laboratories with all necessary equipment and facilities for supporting our teaching and co-curricular activities. The mission of the Department is to produce the highest quality of graduates to serve the society, and to conduct leading-edge research. To this end, we strive for excellence in teaching, research and professional services.</p>
